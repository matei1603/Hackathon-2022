# Hackathon-2022
I participated in a hackathon (HermesHackathon) where we had 24 hours to create an application based on the theme of sustainability.
Our team created a game in Unity where you are a person walking through a forest and collecting recyclable waste(these being added to the inventory) and throwing them in their respective recycling bins. For each recyclable waste you will receive a specific number of points.
The goal is to get as many points as possible in two minutes.
